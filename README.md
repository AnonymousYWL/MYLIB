#LibShalom

LibShalom is a Library for Small Irregular-shaped Matrix Multiplications on ARMv8-based processors. It improves the performance of small and irregular-shaped GEMMs on ARMv8-based
processors by improving the shortcomings of existing BLAS libraries, such as packing accounts for a large portion of the runtime, inefficient edge case processing and unreasonable parallelization methods.
